        <h1 class="mainh1">Alex "Nova" Carter - Frontman & Guitarist</h1>
        <div class="members-images-container"><img src="img/members/Alex.png" class="members-images"></div>
        <p class="members-paragraph">Born and raised in Camden, Alex "Nova" Carter grew up
            surrounded by the gritty pulse of London's underground rock and punk
            scenes. His parents were artists who exposed him to a diverse range
            of music, from Bowie and Led Zeppelin to the more experimental
            sounds of the 80s. As a teenager, Nova found an affinity for metal,
            captivated by its raw energy and emotional depth. After a few stints
            in different local bands, he developed a unique playing style that
            blends intricate riffs with a spacey atmosphere, reflective of his
            fascination with astronomy and science fiction. Nova's lyrics often
            tackle existential questions about humanity's place in the universe
            and the potential for life beyond Earth, mirroring his intense
            curiosity and reflective nature. Known for his haunting vocals and
            intense presence, he became the gravitational force that holds
            SolarSparks together, using music as a way to explore both inner and
            outer worlds.</p>
        <h1 class="mainh1">Mia "Blaze" Torres - Bassist</h1>
        <div class="members-images-container"><img src="img/members/Mia.png" class="members-images"></div>
        <p class="members-paragraph">Originally from Manchester, Mia "Blaze" Torres moved to
            London in her early twenties, drawn by its thriving music scene.
            Blaze picked up the bass guitar at age 12 and quickly developed a
            playing style that fuses heavy metal's weight with a punk rock edge,
            giving her a powerful, thunderous sound. Her rebellious spirit and
            fierce independence made her an integral part of SolarSparks'
            formation; she connected immediately with Nova, sharing his passion
            for music that could transcend earthly limitations. Blaze also
            brings a political edge to the band, channeling her experiences of
            growing up in a working-class neighborhood into lyrics and riffs
            that challenge authority and corporate greed. Outside of music,
            she's deeply involved in London's DIY punk scene, often organizing
            benefit shows for social causes, further rooting SolarSparks in a
            sense of community and resistance.</p>
        <h1 class="mainh1">Jake "The Pulse" Rivers - Drummer</h1>
        <div class="members-images-container"><img src="img/members/Jake.png" class="members-images"></div>
        <p class="members-paragraph">Jake Rivers, better known as "The Pulse," grew up in
            South London with a background in classical percussion, which later
            morphed into a passion for metal drumming. Jake is the band's
            rhythmic backbone, known for his stamina and dynamic playing style,
            which can shift from the slow doom of stoner metal to rapid-fire
            thrash in a heartbeat. Before joining SolarSparks, he played with
            various hardcore bands, developing a reputation as one of the most
            versatile drummers on the local scene. His skill with polyrhythms
            and unconventional time signatures added a unique layer to
            SolarSparks' sound, giving their music a pulsating, unpredictable
            quality. Jake is fascinated by ancient civilizations, especially
            their myths and rhythms, which often inspire the intricate drum
            patterns in SolarSparks' songs. Behind the kit, he's a force of
            nature, bringing a primal energy to their live performances.</p>
        <h1 class="mainh1">Ellie "Neon" Malik - Synthesizer & Sound
            Engineer</h1>
            <div class="members-images-container"><img src="img/members/Ellie.png" class="members-images"></div>
        <p class="members-paragraph">Ellie "Neon" Malik was born in Brixton to a family of
            scientists, but she found her passion in electronic music instead of
            the laboratory. As a child, she would sneak into her father's study
            to experiment with synthesizers and sound software, eventually
            developing a sound that blends darkwave, industrial, and ambient
            textures. Her stage name, “Neon,” reflects both her love for vivid,
            futuristic soundscapes and her fascination with light's role in the
            universe. Neon's contribution to SolarSparks is her ethereal synth
            lines and cosmic sound effects, which transport listeners to
            otherworldly realms. Known for her quiet, introspective nature, Neon
            spends much of her time programming visual effects and projections
            for the band's live shows, enhancing the immersive experience. Her
            scientific background also plays a role in her approach to music,
            treating each song as an experiment in sound, often pushing the
            boundaries of traditional metal with her atmospheric touch.</p>
